<p> <h3>History</h3></p>

<p>Originally called Chitrakuta, the Chittor Fort is said to have been built by Chitranga, a mori king. </p>

<p>The Guhila (Gahlot) ruler Bappa Rawal is said to have captured the fort in either 728 CE or 734 CE. However, some historians doubt the historicity of this legend, arguing that the Guhilas did not control Chittor before the reign of the later ruler Allata.</p>

<p>In 1303, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khilji defeated the Guhila king Ratnasimha, and captured the fort. The fort was later captured by Hammir Singh, a king of the Sisodia branch of the Guhilas. Chittor gained prominence during the period of his successors, which included Rana Kumbha and Rana Sanga. In 1535, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat besieged and conquered the fort. After he was driven away by the Mughal emperor Humayun, the fort was given back to Sisodias by him.</p>

<p>In 1567-68, the Mughal emperor Akbar besieged and captured the fort. In 1615, as part of a peace treaty between Akbar's successor Jahangir and the Maharana of Mewar, Amar Singh I, Mewar accepted Mughal suzerainty and the fort as well as the areas surrounding Chittorgarh were given to Mewar. However, due to the military danger presented by the fort, it was never to be fortified or even repaired. Later, it was occupied by the British Indian Empire</p>

<p><h3> Architecture:</h3></p>
<p>Chittorgarh fort is spread in an area of 700 acres. It has been made in the shape of a large fish and its circumference is 13km. The fort is built on the banks of Gambhri River and a limestone bridge has to be crossed in order to enter the fort. The fort was built on the basis of Hindu architecture though ideas like vaulted substructures belong to Muslim architecture.</p>
