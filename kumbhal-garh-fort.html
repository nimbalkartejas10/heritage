</br>

<p><h3>More Info:</h3></p>
<p>Next on our list of the UNESCO world heritage sites in Rajasthan that you must not miss is Kumbhalgarh Fort. The fortress of Mewar is settled at an altitude of 1100 m in the lap of the Aravalis. It was built in 15th century by Rana Kumbha of the Rajput dynasty. The star attraction of Kumbhalgarh is its fortification of almost 36 km, the longest after the "Great Wall of China". There are almost three hundred and sixty things to explore in the fort including royal mansions, crumbling shrines, temples, wells known as 'baoris', and lush green parks. Do not miss the impressive 'Badal Mahal' and the Shiva Temple.</p>

<p> <h3>History:</h3></p>
<p>The early history of the fort could not be ascertained on account of lack of evidence. The earliest name of the fort is believed to be Machhindrapur, while Sahib Haqim, a historian, named it Mahore. The original fort is believed to have been built by King Samprati of the Maurya Age on account of strategic importance during the 6th century. The subsequent history till 1303 AD till the invasion of Alauddin Khilji is obscure as the fort was insignificant at that time.</p>

<p>Kumbhalgarh in its current form was built by Rana Kumbha who was the Rana of Mewar from the Sisodia rajput clan. Rana Kumbha took the aid of the famous architect of the era, "Mandan". Rana Kumbha's kingdom of Mewar stretched from Ranthambore to Gwalior and included large tracts of what is now Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Out of the 84 forts in his dominion, Rana Kumbha is said to have built 32 of them, of which Kumbhalgarh is the largest and most elaborate.</p>


<p><h3>Architecture</h3></p>
<p>Built on a hilltop 1,100 m (3,600 ft) above sea level on the Aravalli range, the fort of Kumbhalgarh has perimeter walls that extend 36 km (22 mi), making it among the longest walls in the world. The frontal walls are fifteen feet thick. Kumbhalgarh has seven fortified gateways. There are over 360 temples within the fort, 300 ancient Jain and the rest Hindu.[citation needed] From the palace top, it is possible to see kilometers into the Aravalli Range. The sand dunes of the Thar Desert can be seen from the fort walls.</p>

</p>According to popular folklore, Maharana Kumbha used to burn massive lamps that consumed fifty kilograms of ghee and a hundred kilograms of cotton to provide light for the farmers who worked during the nights in the valley.</p>
