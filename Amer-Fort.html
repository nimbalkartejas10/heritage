<p><h3>Info:</h3></p>
<p>Amber Fort or Amer Fort is a fort located in Amber, Rajasthan, India. Amber is a town with an area of 4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi) located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. The town of Amber and the Amber Fort was built by Raja Alan Singh Meena 967 AD, later ruled by kachawaha rajputs. Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur.[4][5] Amber Fort is known for its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks Maota Lake, which is the main source of water for the Amber Palace</p>.

<p>Mughal architecture greatly influenced the architectural style of several buildings
of the fort.Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amber Fort is also popularly known as the Amber Palace. The palace was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a goddess of the Chaitanya cult, which was given to Raja Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh). Raja Man Singh had twelve queens so he made twelve rooms, one for each. Each room had a staircase connected to the kings room but the queens were not to go upstairs. Raja Jai Singh had only one queen so he built one room equal to three old queen's rooms.</p>

<p><h3>History:</h3></p>
<P>The town of Amber and the Amber Fort was built by Raja Alan Singh Meena 967 AD, later ruled by Kachwahas.The Amber Fort, as it stands now, was erected over the remnants of this earlier structure during the reign of Raja Man Singh, the Kachwaha King of Amber. The structure was fully expanded by his descendant, Jai Singh I. Even later, Amber Fort underwent improvements and additions by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until the Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai Singh II, in 1727</p>

<p><h3>Architecture:</h3></p>
<p>The Palace is divided into six separate but main sections each with its own entry gate and courtyard. The main entry is through the Suraj Pol (Sun Gate) which leads to the first main courtyard. This was the place where armies would hold victory parades with their war bounty on their return from battles, which were also witnessed by the Royal family's womenfolk through the latticed windows.This gate was built exclusively[clarification needed] and was provided with guards as it was the main entry into the palace. It faced east towards the rising sun, hence the name "". Royal cavalcades and dignitaries entered the palace through this gate.</p>

<p>Jaleb Chowk is an Arabic phrase meaning a place for soldiers to assemble. This is one of the four courtyards of Amber Palace, which was built during Sawai Jai Singh's reign (1693-1743 AD). Maharaja's personal bodyguards held parades here under the command of the army commander or Fauj Bakshi. The Maharaja used to inspect the guards contingent. Adjacent to the courtyard were the horse stables, with the upper-level rooms occupied by the guards.</p>
